     <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p> <img src="headshot.jpg" alt="Photo of Kaitlin" class="img"> I am an educator with 10 years of experience in the classroom. I recently graduated from North Carolina State Univeristy with my Master's Degree in Learning Design and Technology. Helping teachers effectively integrate technology into their instruction is my passion. I am currently seeking employment as an Instructional Technology Facilitor (ITF) in North Carolina. ITFs are integral to the development, design, implementation and evaluation of technology and technology programs in school districts. They work with a myriad of stakeholders from students and teachers to administrators and superintendents to ensure all learners receive an equitable education that will prepare them for the 21st century. The North Carolina Educator Effectiveness System (NCEES) rubric provides a clear set of standards and competencies that are essential for ITFs to possess in order to be successful and effective. Upon review, this portfolio will demonstrate I have acquired all the necessary competencies of an effective ITF as measured by the NCEES evaluation rubric. To navigate the portfolio, use the top navigation bar to view artifacts grouped by standard.</p>
