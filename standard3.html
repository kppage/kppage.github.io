        <div class="intro"<p>Standard 3: Instructional technology facilitators facilitate the implementation of a comprehensive 21st century instructional technology program.</p></div>

        <div class="description" <p>Standard 3 of the NCEES for Instructional Technology Facilitators emphasizes the need for inquiry-based instruction, effective use of innovative technology, and the appropriate use of technology in the classroom. This section will highlight competencies I have developed to promote safe and effective 21st century learning across school settings.</p></div>
    
    <h2>Online Security Video</h2>
        <p>This project was completed in the Summer of 2020 as part of a course on teaching with digital video. Although this assignment was required for the class, it was also part of a professional consulting project. The class was asked to create a series of security videos for the Computing Science department at NCSU to highlight common cyber security issues and ways to prevent them. Each student was tasked to create one video for the series. The parameters for the project were that each video must be no more than three minutes long, it must be created in PowToon, and must discuss the dangers of the cyber security threat while also presenting steps to prevent the threat. I assumed the role of creating a video on password security and was responsible for the script, animation, editing, compiling, and delivery. This project demonstrates my understanding of cyber security and the importance of creating a comprehensive technology plan that emphasizes a safe digital learning environment for all learners.

    <h2>21st Century Technologies </h2>
        
        <p>This video was created in the Summer of 2020 as coursework for Emerging Technologies. This project required that I complete professional development on an emerging technology of my choice. Parameters of the project were the training had to be at least 30 minutes long and include instruction on an emerging technology, how it works and how to incorporate it in the classroom. I chose to create professional development on the integration of Makey Makey and Scratch to facilitate 21st century thinking and design in classrooms and makerspaces. This is meant to be advanced professional development for teachers already familiar and comfortable with technology integration.  I was responsible for all aspects of creation including developing a script, pacing,  filming, completing voice-over work, video editing, compiling and delivery. All aspects are original, except for the use of several games in Scratch including whack-a-mole, piano keys, and the animal story. This project showcases my skill in developing and modeling effective uses of innovative technologies to drive inquiry-based, 21st century learning.
