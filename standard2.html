            <p>Standard 2 of the NCEES for Instructional Technology Facilitators emphasizes the importance of enabling students to develop global perspectives, to review and refine educational programs and implement universal design principles to meet the needs of all learners. This section will highlight competencies I have developed to ensure the needs of all learners are met while also promoting global competence. </p>

            <h2>Global Project Plan</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text"> The Global Project Plan was created as part of my coursework for Culture, Media and Technology in the Fall of 2019. For the project, I was required to construct a plan that would integrate technology and content standards while building global awareness by connecting students to a class outside of their own culture. The project did not require I implement the plan, only create it. I chose to design a global project for an elementary school classroom integrating social studies standards while connecting students with a class in China to discuss human impacts on the environment. This is an original idea and lesson plan I designed with global competence in mind. Throughout the project U.S. students and Chinese students interact asynchronously via video, Padlet, and other collaborative documents to identify commonalities and generate solutions to environmental impacts faced by both cultures. This project demonstrates my ability to enable students to develop global perspectives through the use of technology, a cornerstone of standard 2.</p>

            <h2>Scratch Fluency Game</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text"> I developed this Scratch-based game in January of 2021 after collaborating and trouble-shooting with colleagues. During a PLT discussion, it became clear many students in 4th grade were performing below benchmark standards and needed fluency intervention. Due to remote learning, the 4th grade teachers had difficulty determining the best way to implement fluency practice. After discussion, the team and I decided to use Quizlet to have students practice this skill. After a week, however, it was clear Quizlet was too complicated for the students to use and many features, including a timer and ability to easily check correct and incorrect answers, were missing. At the next PLT I collected feedback from the 4th grade teachers focusing on desired features of an intervention activity. The teachers indicated they needed something simple to use with a timer. Based on their input, I coded this fluency game which utilizes 20 of the Fry list 3 phrases. Feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and teachers in 3rd, 4th and 5th grade, as well as the reading intervention teacher are currently using this game. The creation of this game demonstrates my ability to review and refine educational programs to meet the needs of a diverse population of students.</p>

            <h2>Universal Design Lesson Plan</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text"> This project was completed in the Spring of 2020 as coursework for Designing and Delivering Online Instruction. I was required to complete a lesson plan utilizing Universal Design to demonstrate my understanding and design capabilities. For the purposes of the course, the plan was not implemented, only designed. The lesson plan is original, but I drew inspiration from the theme of the course, which focused on designing pieces of an online astronomy class. Throughout the lesson plan I incorporated aspects of Universal Design including multiple means of representation, multiple means of action and expression, multiple means of engagement, and multiple means of assessment. This project highlights my understanding and implementation of Universal Design in lesson planning.</p>
